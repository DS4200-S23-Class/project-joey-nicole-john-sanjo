00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.260
analysis of Netflix movie ratings in the U.S

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:13.200
here if I scroll down past our details and get to our visualization section our first&nbsp;
one up is the count of movies released per&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.400
year since 1980 grouped by movie rating so up&nbsp;
here I can click on as many or as little of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.660
rating groups as I want to look at them side&nbsp;
by side over the years I can also hover over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.320
each line to better be able to see which movie&nbsp;
group I'm actually looking at for these lines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.340
scrolling down we have our scatter plot that&nbsp;
is looking at complexity by duration for all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.700
movies but here we're grouping the Same by rating&nbsp;
but we're just looking at your typical G PG PG-13&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.980
Etc movie ratings and I can highlight over and it&nbsp;
will highlight the corresponding bar on the bar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.620
plot to the right and what the bar pod is looking&nbsp;
at is it's grouping again by the same movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.580
ratings but it's looking at the average duration&nbsp;
for all the movies in that rating group and if I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.760
hover over I can look at exactly how many movies&nbsp;
are in that group and exactly what that average&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:28.680
duration is and I can look at this for all of our&nbsp;
movie rating groups as an added bonus I can also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.260
click on one of these and it will pop out a movie&nbsp;
ticket for us so if I click on PG13 it's going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.380
pop out of movie ticket stub that shows us the&nbsp;
average complexity for all of the movies in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.860
rating group and I can do this for all of these&nbsp;
and when I'm done I can just clear the output
