    <h1>Analysis of Netflix Movie Genre Popularity in the United States</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        The rise of streaming platforms like Netflix has led to an explosion
        in the number of movies and TV shows available to the public. With
        so much content to choose from, it can be overwhelming for viewers
        to make informed decisions about what to watch. Our visualization
        tool aims to address this problem by providing users with a way to
        better understand the landscape of film and TV ratings and genres
        throughout the years. By visualizing data about the Motion Picture
        Association rating system, as well as genre and release year informa-
        tion, our tool will help users make more informed decisions about
        what to watch.
        
        Our tool is designed for movie enthusiasts and the general public
        who are interested in understanding the history and evolution of film
        and TV culture. It will support two domain tasks: identifying which
        genres tend to generate certain ratings and analyzing movie and
        TV show ratings throughout the years. By supporting these tasks,
        our tool will enable users to better understand the cultural trends
        and shifts in the film and TV industry, and make more informed
        decisions about what movies and TV shows to watch. 

        This visualization tool will cater to movie enthusiasts and the general
        public to better illustrate the progression of movie and TV show
        ratings throughout the years, as well as Motion Picture Association
        ratings and general film and TV show genres available on Netflix.
        The tool will be able to display to the user the movie name, release
        year, ratings, genre, and more. The user will also be able to interact
        with the plot to zoom in on certain periods of interest, as well as
        being able to select desired filters. By using this tool, the public
        will be able to get a better understanding of the Motion Picture
        Association rating system, as well as movie culture shifts throughout
        the years.

        <h2>Background</h2>
       
        <h3>Data</h3>
        The selected data comes from Kaggle, and is a compiled
        list of Netflix movies and TV shows, with related vari-
        ables such as cast, director, release date, ratings, and more
        (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows). There
        are no inherent biases in the dataset, other than not knowing the
        credibility of the Kaggle user who compiled the data. Ethical consid-
        erations could be social responsibility, however, there is no personal
        user data and the societal impacts of this dataset are low ethically
        speaking.

        To clean the dataset, we used Python to sift through missing
        values and omit unnecessary data.
        Additionally, rows with null values were dropped. 
        We then filtered the data such that the only
        country included with data was the United States. These steps
        brought the row count from around 8,000, to roughly 1800. For
        consistency purposes, The date column was then transformed into a
        proper datetime format. The word ‘minutes’ was also removed from
        this column in order to have a cleaner appearance. A new column
        for complexity was also added based on the original description
        column, using the automated rate-ability index, roughly based on
        the character length of the description column. Then, the description
        column was dropped, as it would not be relevant for our analyses
        purposes. Finally, originally the “listed in” column, referring to the
        genre, was just a singular column that contained one or more genres
        that the project was listed in. To better be able to manipulate the
        data, we found every type of genre listed in the rows, and created its
        own column based on those findings. The new rows now show a 1
        or 0 (yes or no), if it was listed in that specific genre or not. After
        cleaning, there were no unexpected values or outliers
